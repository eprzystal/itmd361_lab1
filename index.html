    <h1>ITMD-361 Lab 1</h1>
  <p>Hello world. This is my first website ever!</p>
  <p>My name is Elizabeth Przystal and I am a new student at IIT.</p>
  <p>I am working on completing my Web and Application Development Certification from IIT.</p>
  <p>I am a designer who graduated from Columbia College with a degree in Graphic Arts.</p>
  <p>I was a graphic designer for several years than transitioned to a 3D designer working in Corporate Events.</p>
  <p>All was going well...and then COVID hit.  All live events came to a hiatus so I am working on my cerfication to become a UX Designer.</p>
  <p>I'm really excited to be a part of this class, with a bit of terrified at all I will be learning.</p>
